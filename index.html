 <h1> How wildfires affect home prices and what it means for Los Angeles </h1>

 <h2> After over 10,000 homes were destroyed in Los Angeles, there are concerns about an increase in home prices. Experts, however, say you might not need to be worried. </h2>

  <p> In January of this year, wildfires in Los Angeles County ravaged through communities and shocked residents of both the area and the wider state. California, of course, is used to wildfires, with headlines about different blazes making national news each year. However, the timing and the destruction was surprising. The fires occurred in the midst of winter, where temperatures are cooler than those typical of fire season in California. As for the destruction, nearly 40,000 acres were affected by the Palisades and Eaton fires. This is not that much compared to other costly fires in California, but is more than made up for in the amount of property completely destroyed by the fires. </p>

<p> The LA fires give Los Angeles County, an area not typically as affected by wildfires compared to other parts of the state, some of the most property damage from wildfires in the state. A lot of the buildings destroyed in these fires were single family homes. This leads to thousands of people losing their livelihoods and makes it hard to bounce back. History and recent trends suggest that it could be hard to recover, as seen with the one fire that destroyed more structures than the one in LA. </p>

<p> The 2018 Camp Fire in Butte County emptied entire towns and destroyed nearly 20,000 structures. A lot of these structures were homes and forced many to either relocate or rebuild. As a result, in the next year, Butte County saw a 14 percent increase in median home prices, largely driven by outsiders from the San Francisco Bay Area looking to get in on a hot market. </p> 

<p> Butte, while a fair comparison in terms of destruction to the fires in LA, might not be fair in terms of home prices, however. The $444,000 median sale of homes in Butte County ranks in the bottom half of the state. A more comparable county, therefore, could be Napa County. This area is famous for its vineyards and upper class communities but was also heavily affected by the Tubbs Fire in 2017 and the Glass Fire in 2020. </p>

<p> In the aftermath of the fire, the region saw an 18 percent increase in single family home prices. In the opinion of Arthur Goodrich, a realtor specializing in luxurious home sales in Napa County, this can be chalked up to a simple reason. </p>

<p> “It’s an issue of supply and demand,” Goodrich said. “Housing availability in Napa Valley was already so tight prior to the fires. After so many people were displaced from their homes, many of them had to find alternative housing in the area since they work in the area.” </p>

<p> Back in Los Angeles, estimates suggest that nearly 150,000 people were displaced by the Palisades and Eaton fires. In a region already so affected by rising home prices, that could make rebuilding livelihoods difficult for so many. </p>

<p> Over the last five years, Los Angeles County has seen a 32 percent increase in home prices. While a lot of the focus on the fires were in upper class communities like the Palisades or Calabasas - where median home prices are already above $2 million - many affected by the fires were from middle class areas like Altadena. Altadena, a city populated by artists and blue collar workers, sees some of the highest home ownership rates from African Americans in the country. The median home price, while high at $1 million, is similar to Napa County where many local residents were priced out of homes. </p>

<p> Goodrich, however, believes residents in Los Angeles don’t have to worry about being priced out of homes because of how expansive the metropolitan area is. </p>

<p> “It’s possible that prices could increase in the immediate area,” Goodrich said. “But LA is a tremendous metroplex that can absorb the replacement housing needs, unlike the much smaller areas of Napa Valley.” </p>

<p> Already, results could be encouraging for LA residents. At the start of the year, the median home price was at $886,400. Over the next two months, that number dropped by six percent to $829,260. While this might be good news for some residents, who were worried about relocating or being priced out, it does not make up for the homes destroyed or the memories lost by the fires in January. </p>
